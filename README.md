# LinearResponseVariationalBayes.py

## Deprecated

This is an experimental library intended to make sensitivity analysis and
optimization easier for variational approximations.  Its main use now is to
reproduce the experiments in
[rgiordan/CovariancesRobustnessVBPaper](https://github.com/rgiordan/CovariancesRobustnessVBPaper).
I will no longer maintain this repo.

Instead, please use the following libraries:

- For parameter packing: [rgiordan/paragami](https://github.com/rgiordan/paragami)
- For sensitivity analysis: [rgiordan/vittles](https://github.com/rgiordan/vittles)

## How to install, if you must.

You should be able to install the package with the command
```pip install LinearResponseVariationalBayes```.

See ```Example.ipynb``` for a description and example usage.
